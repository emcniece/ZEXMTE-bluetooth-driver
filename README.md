## Driver Files

- [bluetooth.iso](https://github.com/emcniece/ZEXMTE-bluetooth-driver/blob/main/bluetooth.iso): a straight `cat` of the mounted media to file, done in Ubuntu 20
- [User Manual.pdf](https://github.com/emcniece/ZEXMTE-bluetooth-driver/blob/main/User%20Manual.pdf): manual as provided on the mini CD
- [RTL_Windows](https://github.com/emcniece/ZEXMTE-bluetooth-driver/tree/main/RTL_Windows): the extracted drivers from bluetooth.iso

Both the ISO and extracted drivers are committed for ease of installation, in the off chance that the ISO fails to mount you can simply download this entire repo and run the installer for your OS version.
